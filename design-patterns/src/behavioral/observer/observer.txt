#The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern :
where an object (called the Subject) maintains a list of dependents (Observers) and notifies them automatically of any state changes.

#Real-World Analogy
Think of a YouTube channel (Subject) and its subscribers (Observers).
When the channel uploads a new video (state change), all subscribers get notified.

| Component          | Role                                                       |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Subject`          | Maintains a list of observers and notifies them of changes |
| `Observer`         | Defines an update method to be called when notified        |
| `ConcreteSubject`  | Holds state and notifies observers on change               |
| `ConcreteObserver` | Implements the `Observer` interface                        |

 (Subject/observable (YouTube Channel)[interface])            --------->                 (Observer Interface)
            |                                                                                     |
            | is-a                                                                                |is-a
   Subject/observable concrete class                                                     Observer concrete class

# When to Use the Observer Design Pattern
The Observer Pattern is ideal for scenarios where one objectâ€™s state changes should automatically notify other dependent objects
without tight coupling. Here are the key use cases:

1. Event-Driven Systems
âœ… Use Case: When an object (Subject) needs to broadcast events to multiple listeners (Observers).
ðŸ“Œ Examples:
UI Button Clicks (e.g., Java Swing ActionListener, Android OnClickListener).
Game Engines (e.g., notifying players when a game event occurs).
âœ… Use Case: When data changes (e.g., stock prices, weather updates) must be pushed to multiple consumers.
ðŸ“Œ Examples:
Stock Market Apps (e.g., updating charts when prices change).
IoT Sensors (e.g., temperature sensors notifying dashboards).
3. Decoupling Publishers and Subscribers
âœ… Use Case: When the sender (Subject) shouldnâ€™t know details about receivers (Observers).
ðŸ“Œ Examples:
Logging Systems (e.g., log events sent to files, databases, and alerts).
Chat Applications (e.g., messages broadcast to multiple users).
4. MVC (Model-View-Controller) Architecture
âœ… Use Case: When the Model (data) changes, Views (UI) should update automatically.
ðŸ“Œ Examples:
Weather App (Model updates temperature â†’ UI refreshes).
E-Commerce (Cart changes â†’ Checkout summary updates).
