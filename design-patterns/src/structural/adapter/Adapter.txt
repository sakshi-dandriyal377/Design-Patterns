#Adapter Design Pattern
The Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together.
Adapter design pattern is one of the structural design pattern and it is used so that two unrelated interfaces can work together.
The object that joins these unrelated interfaces is called an adapter.

Example:-
One real-world example of the Adapter Design Pattern is a mobile charger.
Mobile chargers act as adapters between the power socket and the mobile device,
converting the voltage to a suitable level for charging the device.
In software development, the Adapter Design Pattern follows the same concept by introducing an additional adapter class
between an existing interface and a class that needs to work with it.

Key Components of the Adapter Pattern:
Target: The interface that the client expects.
Adapter: The class that implements the Target interface and wraps an Adaptee object.
Adaptee: The existing class that needs to be adapted.
Client: The class that interacts with the Target interface.
